My name is Isaac Gray, I graduated from Berea College. I am 24 years old and have a BA in Computer Science. I was always great with design, conceptual theory and logic behind computer science, but struggled creating things during my education. This is part of a road to help strengthen my soft skills so I may create, explore, and learn on my own in the world.
